This page contains hyperlinked graphical illustrations and raw data from the TraPS-VarI computational analyses of human genotyping datasets. This work identifies all the human receptor variants "CREATING" a membrane-proximal STAT3 binding site. Being germline encoded, such protein variants elevate levels of tyrosine phosphorylated (pY705) STAT3 in cell types such as immune cells. Thus amplitude of STAT3 signaling is enhanced in individuals based on their genotypes. For selected variants, expression pattern in immune cell types is graphically illustrated. This study reports the identification of the pleiotropic immune evasive functions of STAT3-enhancing receptor variants.
